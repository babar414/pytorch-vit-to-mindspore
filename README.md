# pytorch-vit-to-mindspore
This repository contains python script to convert pytorch-vit model weights into mindspore vit model weights. The conversion is verified by converting MAE Imagnet-1k fine-tuned ViT model weights from PyTorch to Mindspore and then evaluating and comparing the top-1 accuracy.
